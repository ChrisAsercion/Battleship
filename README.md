Iteration 3 was a little harder without an iteraction pattern, but it helped we already had so much built up at this point. The flow of where to go with the project seemed straightfoward because we established so much already.

If I had one more day to work on this project, I would work on a method to expand the board and then working on adding in more ships as a method. After spending a lot of time working on it, the computer placing method became more dynamic and able to take in more varied information which could allow for more ships then initially intended.

Working with Paul we used several different work collaboration styles. It was often helpful to us to plan what we did on a Miro board to show the progress of the project and where it was going. We worked individually, as well as paired code collaboration to work together.

Feedback was good, but I could personally use more direction in the more technical aspects of the project. The feedback was given more on the project overall.
